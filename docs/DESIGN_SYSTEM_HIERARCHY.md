# Syntheverse Design System Hierarchy

## Overview

The Syntheverse platform implements a three-tier design language that reflects the functional hierarchy of the system. Each interface has a distinct aesthetic that communicates its purpose and operational context.

### 4. **SynthScan MRI Submission** → **MRI Control Panel Design**
**Metaphor:** Medical imaging control room / Diagnostic examination console

**Aesthetic:**
- Medical-grade interface
- Clinical precision
- Diagnostic displays
- Examination protocols
- Imaging status and results

**Visual Language:**
- Clean, clinical white/blue palette
- Medical-grade typography
- Examination status displays

- Light gradient backgrounds (slate-50 to white)
- Operator information panels
- Imaging data input sections
- Diagnostic result displays

**CSS:** `synthscan-mri.css`

**Purpose:** Contributors submit their work for SynthScan™ MRI evaluation. The interface mimics a medical MRI control panel where operators prepare patients (contributions) for imaging, monitor the scanning process, and review diagnostic results (PoC scores and evaluations).

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Medical-grade MRI control panel interface
- Clean white/blue clinical palette (#2563eb)
- Operator information panels
- Examination protocols and imaging data input
- Signal meters with diagnostic states
- MRI report dialog with scanning status

## Design Resonance

The design hierarchy creates clear visual and conceptual resonance:

1. **Cockpit** = Individual operator perspective (pilot)
2. **Control Lab** = Creator/scientist perspective (researcher)
3. **Command Center** = System-wide coordination (mission control)
4. **MRI Control Panel** = Diagnostic evaluation (medical technician)

Each interface communicates its function through design language alone, creating an intuitive navigation experience where users understand their context and capabilities based on visual cues.
